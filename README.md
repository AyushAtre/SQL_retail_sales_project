# SQL_retail_sales_project


Project Overview
Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

# Objectives
Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.

Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.

Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

# Data Description 
The dataset comprises 2,000 retail transaction records, capturing essential details about sales and customer behavior in a retail environment. Each transaction includes a unique transaction ID, the date and time of purchase, and the customer ID associated with the sale. Customer demographics are recorded through attributes such as gender and age. Product-related fields include the category of the item (Clothing, Electronics, or Grocery), quantity purchased (noted as "quantiy" due to a minor typo), price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and the total sale value. While the majority of the data is complete, a few records contain missing values in fields such as age, quantity, price per unit, COGS, and total sale. This dataset offers a well-rounded view of transactional activity and is well-suited for performing customer segmentation, sales trend analysis, profitability assessment, and business performance tracking.
